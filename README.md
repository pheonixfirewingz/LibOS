## Contribution rules

  - keep formatting the same as the rest of the project's
  - focus on speed and optimization
  - try to be memory safe (not required as a temp fix)

## Formatting

Nobody is perfect, and sometimes we mess things up. That said, Here are some good dos & don't to try and stick to:

**Do:**

  - Write in idiomatic C++20
  - Use `clang-format` (version 11 or later) to automatically format C++ files ot project style.
  - Choose expressive variable, function and class names. Make it as obvious as possible what the code is doing.
  - Split your changes into separate, atomic commits.
  - Make sure your commits are rebased on the master branch.
  - Wrap your commit messages at 72 characters.
  - Write the commit message subject line in the imperative mood ("Foo: Change the way dates work", not "Foo: Changed the way dates work").
  - Write your commit messages in proper English, with care and punctuation.
  - Squash your commits when making revisions after a patch review.
  - Add your personal copyright line to files when making substantive changes. (Optional but encouraged!)
  - Check the spelling of your code, comments and commit messages.

**Don't:**

  - Submit code that's incompatible with the project licence (GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, February 1999)
  - Touch anything outside the stated scope of the PR.
  - Iterate excessively on your design across multiple commits.
  - Use weasel-words like "refactor" or "fix" to avoid explaining what's being changed.
  - End commit message subject lines with a period.
  - Include commented-out code.
  - Write in C. (Instead, take advantage of C++'s amenities, and don't limit yourself to the standard C library.)
  - Attempt large architectural changes until you are familiar with the system and have worked on it for a while.
